# Simple steps to get started

1. Install basic libraries - `pip install matplotlib cantera tensorflow`
2. Install the SL-GPS library - `pip install slgps`
3. Test your installation by running any of the files in the [tests folder](tests/)
4. The trained neural network is stored as .h5 file which can be accessed and utilized to produced reduced mechanisms for any given composition, temperature and pressure.

# SL-GPS
This repository contains the means to create a neural network architecture for dynamic chemistry reduction based on reduction results from Global Pathway Selection. The basic procedure is to first run adaptive GPS for 0D auto-ignition simulation so as to create a dataset. This dataset is later used for training the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). You can reach out to us at rmishra@tamu.edu (Rohit Mishra) or aaronnelson@tamu.edu (Aaron Nelson) for code issues, suggestions and/or pull requests. The step-by-step procedure to use this repository is as follows:

## About
This code was developed entirely in Python 3. Dependent packages include Cantera 2, Tensorflow 2, pandas, sklearn, numpy, pickle, and networkx. Code for GPS has been copied from https://github.com/golsun/GPS and modified to work in Python 3.
