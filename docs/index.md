# SL-GPS: Supervised Learning - Global Pathway Selection

[cite_start]This repository contains the means to create a **neural network architecture for dynamic chemistry reduction** based on reduction results from **Global Pathway Selection (GPS)**[cite: 186554, 186638].

The basic procedure is:
1. [cite_start]Run **adaptive GPS** for 0D auto-ignition simulation to create a dataset[cite: 186554, 186638].
2. [cite_start]Use this dataset for **training the Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**[cite: 186554, 186638].
