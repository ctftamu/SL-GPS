# SL-GPS
This repository contains the means to create a neural network architecture for dynamic chemistry reduction based on reduction results from Global Pathway Selection. 
## Creating an ANN
To produce a new ANN as an h5 file, run the main.py file. If the input parameter 'data_path' specified at the top of the file points to a pre-existing directory containing the state vector and reduced species data, an ANN will be trained to select a reduced set of species given a thermochemical state as input. If the data does not exist, a series of autoignition simulations will be run across a random set of initial conditions, and classic GPS will be run on the results to produce a set of data that is stored at the specified directory. The nature of these simulations is controlled by the other input parameters in main.py, including the ranges of initial temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios considered, the number of cases run, and the tolerance of GPS in including species ("alpha").

The architecture of the neural network defaults to one hidden layer with 16 neurons, but this can be changed in "mech_train.py" in the indicated section of code. Other hyperparameters of the training process can also be edited in this file, which uses the Python Keras API in Tensorflow 2.
